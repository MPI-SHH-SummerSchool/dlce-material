## Welcome to the class on "Introduction to Linguistic & Cultural Evolution" 
### taught by [Annika Tjuka](http://annikatjuka.com).

_Monday, Aug 16 at 12.15am_

In this folder, you'll find the material for our class. If you have time, please read (one of) the key reference articles that will give you some insight into the topic.

I will add the presentation slides after the class, so that you can check out all the links and references.

The class will be recorded so you can watch it (again) later. I will add the link here as soon as it is available.
