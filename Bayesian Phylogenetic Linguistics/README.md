## Welcome 
### to the class on "Bayesian Phylogenetic Linguistics" taught by Annika Tjuka, Nataliia Hübler and Olena Shcherbakova.

_Friday, Aug 20 at 9am_

In this folder, you'll find the material for our class. If you have time, please read our key reference article that will give you some insight into the topic of our class.

We will add the presentation slides after the class, so that you can check out all the links and references.

Our class will be recorded so you can watch it (again) later. We will add the link here as soon as it is available.
